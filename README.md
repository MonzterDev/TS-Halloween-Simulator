# TS-Halloween-Simulator

The first game I've created using Roblox TypeScript! 

Please understand this game was never intended to be published and was only created as a learning project. 
There are flaws with the game, including UI, certain unfinished systems, & more, but I wanted to release it so I can get feedback about my code and move on to the next project!

Hopefully others can use this project to learn, get ideas, or take inspiration from!

## Systems

The focus of this project was to make most of the modern day Simulator systems and features.

* Currency / Points
* Redeem Codes
* Pet & Boost Inventory
* Pet Index
* Egg Hatching
* Monetization Store (Gamepassess + Dev Products)
* Quests
* Map
* Settings
* Upgrade Shop
* Unlockable Areas
* Daily Group Reward
* Daily Gifts
* Notifications

## Game Loop

Players can collect and sell Candy to earn Money.
With that money, players can purchase Basket Upgrades, hatch Pet Eggs, and unlock new Areas.
